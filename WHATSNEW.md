Version 1.3
===========

Added a basic stub of the Abacus ADvance API.
The primary usecase is for testing the codebase, but it can be used as well for when you are developing your app offline
or have not yet been given access to an ADvance account. 

Version 1.2
===========

Be less strict in validating the parameters for the `logWebActivity` call

Version 1.1
===========

Accept by default unknown properties for the valueObjects that get built from ADvance responses. This makes the 
bundle more elastic with forward-compatibility. 


Version 1.0.2
=============

Fixed constructors of exceptions


Version 1.0.1
=============

Fix usage of non-existent parameter
